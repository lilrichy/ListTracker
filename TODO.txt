Remove Objective Links
Check Icon Visibility option works on options window 
    - Missing Function
    - Add ask to reload dialog when check box changes or chat command used
Weekly and Manual checkboxes should be able to be unchecked with out checking the other and 
    only change the other if it was checked so that unchecked can be used for dailys. - BUG!!!
